Sample repository showing how to develop version controlled [Structurizr](structurizr.com) [C4 model](c4model.com) locally with resulting diagrams hosted using [MkDocs](mkdocs.org) static page generator. This is little more than a bit of glue code to contain everything in a single repo (could be part of your app repo if you want everything together) sprinkled with GitHub automation to host the result as GH Pages, but I hope this can be used to save you a bit of time if you're trying to solve the same problem and, like me a just few days ago, are not familiar with the tooling.

## Why
Tl;dr version: if your organization needs, size and complexity allows it, I recommend giving [Structurizr cloud](https://structurizr.com/pricing) a go. It offers more functionality than what you'll find in this repo and at the moment of writing this it feels like the features are coming faster and faster. There is also a self-hosted option with some limitations. But if for any reason you can't or don't want to use cloud Structurizr and are looking for local or statically hosted option, read on!

Using Structurizr to describe your app or the whole product landscape in a single place, and generate diagrams as needed from that. There's a good explanation of the [difference between diagramming and modelling](https://c4model.com/#Modelling) on the C4 pages. However if you don't want to use the cloud or self-hosted Structurizr options and just need a few diagrams to show in a lightweight documentation, it's usually up to you to figure out the tooling and process. This repo is an example of such process, using MkDocs as the static docs generator and GH Pages as the hosting.

## How it works
[MkDocs](mkdocs.org) is a widely used solution to generate static pages from a bit of configuration and a hierarchy of markdown documents. It's a python tool that you can [install locally to get started](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/) and add plugins to extend the behavior. The two important plugins for us are [macros](https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs_macros_plugin) and [mermaid2](https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin) which allow us to include contents of another file in our docs markdown document and render mermaid syntax as a diagram on the resulting page.

We can get the diagrams in mermaid syntax using [Structurizr CLI](https://github.com/structurizr/cli) which offers [exporting the model into various other formats](https://github.com/structurizr/cli/blob/master/docs/export.md#examples).

The rest is just glue to make this work together. As you make changes to the model file, you can either view them locally using [Structurizr Lite](https://structurizr.com/help/lite) by starting `run-structurizr-lite.sh` on your machine and navigating to `localhost:8080`. To view the full result export the mermaid files using `export-structurizr-diagrams.sh` script, include them in the documentation with a macro like `{% include 'diagrams/structurizr-Diagram1.mmd' %}`, build the docs and serve on localhost with `mkdocs serve` and navigate to `localhost:8000` to see the result.
